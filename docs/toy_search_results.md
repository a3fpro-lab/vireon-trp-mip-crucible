# Toy Search Results (Sanity Check)

This file is for recording actual numeric outputs from:

- `python scripts/run_toy_baseline.py`
- `python scripts/run_toy_vireon.py`
- `python scripts/run_invariant_demo.py`

## Example placeholders

Replace these with real runs once executed on a laptop or Codespace.

### Toy baseline

- Runs: 20
- Avg nodes expanded: N_base (to be filled)
- Median nodes expanded: M_base (to be filled)
- Avg best true value: V_base (to be filled)

### Toy VIREON

- Runs: 20
- Avg nodes expanded: N_vir (to be filled)
- Median nodes expanded: M_vir (to be filled)
- Avg best true value: V_vir (to be filled)

### Invariant demo

- Original KL(q_new || q_ref): K_orig (to be filled)
- KL(q_leashed || q_ref): K_leash (to be filled)
- KL reduction factor: K_leash / K_orig (to be filled)

These numbers turn the abstract math into concrete evidence: the code
matches the stated properties and invariants.
